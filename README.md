Ideas and collective agreement on the design for our group project game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This game will be a 2D side on dungeons crawl game. This will be retro-style in terms of graphics.

The user will progress through levels fighting mobs of students and/or teachers.

This can be fort with uni related weapons like throwing pencils lol.

Also, collectables can be used to display the more informative part of the game kinda.

Players will have to collect pieces of schoolwork, like chunks of code to formulate an assignment for each module. If they collect enough they will get a mark depending on how many they have found. 

The player can progress through different parts of the Isaac Newton building, ultimately ending up at the same final boss.

Each level may have a set of mobs or a mini boss to fight.

Slight exploration to be implemented so the player can collect pieces of work.
